# todoList-app-react-native
simple todo list tracking app designed with React Native.


I have been building Web Apps with React.JS for a couple months now and I was curious about React Native.

I took some time to look into React Native and learned that it is a framework to allow app development for both IOS and androis while using JavaScript. I was excited to see what I can accomplish by creating phone apps with the skills I have learned.

This is a simple ToDo List app, like many others. It is a single page app which allows a user to add a task, add it to the list, and tap on the list to remove it from the list. The UI is simple and clean to represent modern app development trends and allow for simplicity.

This is a basic app just to showcase the main concepts of React Native and utilizing them. I will be working on improving the app and add more personalizing.

The bigger push to learn React Native was when I met with the CEO of a web developing company and he said he was interested in seeing my React Native work. Now I have proof to show what I learned in a week's worth of dedication.
